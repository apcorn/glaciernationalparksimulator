# glaciernationalparksimulator
A simulation tool for studying visitor parking at Glacier National Park

This code is by no means good, nor should it stand as an example to aspire to. I wrote it quickly and changed it often to meet the needs of our client and the project. I'm releasing it here in the hopes that it will be useful for someone else, and/or that the Park can use or extend it in the future.
